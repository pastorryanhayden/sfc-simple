<p>Featured Images need to be a 16 x 9 image. (1920x1080, 1280x720, 1152x648, etc.)  Most slides and TVs use this aspect ratio, and we wanted your images to be usable for many different things.  You could create these images in photoshop, export a slide in powerpoint or keynote.  There are many ways to create one of these images.</p>
